Hi, I’m **Divesh Basina**.

I build machine learning systems that are both principled and practical.

I’m currently a graduate student at Arizona State University pursuing my Master's thesis in Implicit Neural Representation. I work on neural network architectures for image quality improvement, medical imaging, semantic and stance detection from texts. My focus is on understanding *why* models work, not just pushing benchmark numbers — and then translating that understanding into systems that are efficient, reliable, and deployable.

My work spans:

- Deep learning architecture design  
- Medical imaging and high-fidelity visual models  
- Image rendering and quality enhancement  
- Systems-level foundations (operating systems, memory management, virtualization)  

I’ve evaluated emerging architectures like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, built operating system components in xv6, and developed end-to-end ML pipelines — from experimentation to measurable results. That combination of low-level systems knowledge and high-level modeling lets me think holistically about performance, scalability, and real-world constraints.

I’m currently looking for industry roles where I can contribute to applied AI systems that make a tangible impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy yoga and video games with economies.
