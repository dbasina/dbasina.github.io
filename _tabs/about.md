Hi, I’m **Divesh Basina**.

I’m a graduate student at Arizona State University and a researcher under professor Kookjin Lee. My work focuses on designing and understanding neural network architectures for computer vision.

My current research explores:
- Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)
- Implicit neural networks
- Medical imaging models
- Architecture-level inductive biases
- Real-time vision systems

I’m particularly interested in foundational architectural design that improves generalization and efficiency.
Outside of research, I enjoy running and strategy-based video games with dynamic economies.
